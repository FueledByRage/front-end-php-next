# About it 
It's an exercise project to put in pratice what i've learned about React and study NextJs and it's features.
It's functionality consist of creating a profile and posting videos.

# Why 
I found the server side rendering interesting and since i wanted to start a new project using PHP on back-end 
putting it all togheter just fitted well.

# Screens
I'll be uploading new screenshots since the project now is about posting videos and has got new features.
